To be eligible for funding, you must meet the following criteria:

1. **Be a student**. You must be an undergraduate, graduate, or PhD student at an accredited university or institution, in any country.

1. **Be accepted by a conference**. Your paper must be accepted at a top-tier, peer reviewed academic conference in the fields of blockchains, security, cryptography, distributed systems, or privacy. To ensure impartiality, we only support conferences whose peer review process is triple blind (reviewers don't know authors; authors don't know reviewers; and reviewers cannot see other reviews when reviewing). More specifically, we cover travel expenses for the following conferences:
    1. In the field of **blockchains**:
        1. Financial Cryptography (FC)
        1. Financial Cryptography workshops such as the Workshop on Trusted Smart Contracts (FC WTSC)
        1. ACM Advances in Financial Technologies (AFT)
    1. In the field of **security**:
        1. IEEE Security & Privacy (Oakland)
        1. ACM Computer and Communications Security (CCS)
        1. USENIX Security
        1. Network and Distributed Systems Security (NDSS)
        1. AsiaCCS
        1. EuroS&P
        1. ESORICS
    1. In the field of **cryptography**:
        1. CRYPTO
        1. EUROCRYPT
        1. The Theory of Cryptography Conference (TCC)
        1. ASIACRYPT
    1. In the field of **distributed computing**:
        1. ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC)
        1. International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC)
    1. In the field of **privacy**:
        1. The Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS)

1. **Be on-topic**. Your paper must fall within the field of Blockchain Science and preferably within our [thirteen research directions](/directions).

1. **Have no other funding**. We might cover your trip fully or partially. You cannot have other sources of funding for the portions of your expenses that we cover.

1. **Be a speaker**. You must be the speaker presenting the paper at the conference. We will fund up to one speaker per paper.

1. **Be open**. Your paper must be openly published under a Creative Commons license for perpetuity. It must be made available in one of the following archives:
    1. [ePrint](https://eprint.iacr.org/): The cryptography repository of academic papers.
    1. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/): The general repository of academic papers.

    If your paper includes an implementation, your implementation must be published as open source software under an AGPL, GPL, MIT, BSD, or Apache license. The code must be made available on GitHub or GitLab. If your paper includes an attack or relevant tool, your code must still be made open source after appropriate responsible disclosure.

    You also agree to keep the research described in the paper free of patents and available for anyone to implement.

    It is your responsibility to ensure that the paper and the code remains available in these repositories even after the completion of the conference.

1. **Be ethical**. If your paper includes human subjects, or pertains to an attack or relevant tool, you must follow the ethical guidelines of your university and receive approval from your university's review board. You must follow a responsible disclosure process.
